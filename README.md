# Inspiration
Do you remember those ads on TV where you stared at a sad puppy that could only dream of being adopted for just pennies a day? What if I told you that it cost $34,000 to get that puppy adopted? Well, this is exactly how much it costs the ASPCA to get each animal adopted. We believe that philanthropists of all sizes should be able to easily understand how much of their donations goes to the things they believe in, and how much goes into the CEO's pockets and into TV ads. 

This can be migrated to combat a lack of organizational transparency in public organizations claiming to do good.

# What it does
Provides an interface where we provide philanthropists with a transparent view into what charities are spending their donations on. Likewise, it is a place for charities to rapidly adapt their contribution sectors to test out what inspires philanthropists to donate.
